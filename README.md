FreeCodeCamp: JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects - Caesars Cipher

This Caesars cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known data encryption techniques.  It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is 'shifted' a certain number of places down the alphabet. Here presented cipher is based on ROT13 algorithm.
